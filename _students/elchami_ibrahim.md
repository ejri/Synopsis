Bio:

I am an engineering grad student at SFU (BSc in biophysics). My academic and research work in Canada and the EU encompass interdisciplinary fields and involves integrating aspects of sciences and engineering to develop multidisciplinary solutions, mostly related to sensors (micro)fabrication (in Si) and the integration of sensors in a wide range of applications. 

My research and extracurricular projects, as well as my research goals, have always been aimed towards developing solutions that contribute to enhancing longevity and the overall quality of people's lives, regardless of where they are.

 Some of my extracurricular work is related to architecting and building IoT systems in healthtech, agritech, cleantech, the future of mobility, and smart city applications, through integrating several custom aspects of hardware and software. 
 
 The projects can be seen in more details on my online portfolio (link at signature).
 
 My health-related projects have been aimed towards early (cancer) detection as well as preventative analysis, though they encompass a broader range, including reducing stress levels for medical staff and first responders as well as reducing ER wait-times, where I have built custom wearables as well as designed apps and platforms. 
 
 Some brief description of projects:
 
- custom-built system to imitate heart beating and breathing patterns for CT scanner calibrations. 

- Auto detection of tumours in lungs in CT scan images to be used for tumors’ predictive analysis. 

- A predictive analysis system that estimates the probability of patients incurring or recurring myocardial infraction/ cardiac arrest based on patient history and ECG signals.

- Help reduce stress levels for medical staff and first responders by integrating a custom-built wearable with a custom-built app to monitor stress levels throughout shifts as well as notify users when their stress levels are higher than the team average and users’ past stress data. 

- A hardware-AI integration system that can potentially be used in ER’s and hospitals to help assess patients’ urgency levels upon admission, as well as during monitoring/ recovery periods. The system also aims to reduce stress on medical staff, without sacrificing patient care.

- Microsoft’s AI for Earth grant as a lead researcher for my proposal in utilizing a hardware-AI integration to create precision agricultural hubs, that focus on energy efficient autonomous agriculture.
